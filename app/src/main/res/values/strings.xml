    <string name="rules">The basic premise of the game is this: you roll six dice.
        Some combinations of dice will score points, while others don’t. You take
        out the dice that have scored points and then decide whether to keep that
        score, or re-roll the remaining dice to try to score more points.
        But if you roll again and don’t score points, you lose what you’ve
        earned so far. So the game moves quickly and there’s an element of risk
        that makes it really fun to play.</string>
